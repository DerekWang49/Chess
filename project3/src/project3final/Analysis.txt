ArrayList Runtime of get(int index) method: O(n) complexity
LinkedList Runtime of get(int index) method: O(n) complexity
The array has a time complexity of O(n) because the element is searched until the inputed index is reached
The linked list has a time complexity of O(n) because the for loop ends when it reaches the index.

Rotate (incomplete)

ArrayList Runtime of merge(List<T>otherList) method: O(n) complexity
There is only one for loop for the method and it depends on the length of the combined list

ArrayList Runtime of reverse(): O(n) complexity
Even though the for loop only runs for half the size of the list, it is still O(n) complexity because it is linearly
dependent on the size of the list
