To run, navigate to the directories containing ArrayList.java and LinkedList.java. They can be run separately. As of now,
the isSorted instance variable, merge method, rotate method, and sort method are not fully functional in ArrayList.java.
In LinkedList.java, only both add methods, clear, and get methods are functional.
